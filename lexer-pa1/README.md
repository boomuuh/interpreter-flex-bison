Interpreter with Flex and Bison

Steps: 
1. Using regular expressions, the file is lexed to separate tokens, such as Strings, Comments, Ints, etc. While identifying keywords
or identifiers such as variables and whatever other syntax there is in any language. Flex is used to identify tokens and specific
keywords in the file. 
2. Next is parsing and identifing a language structure with context free grammar. Must decide between left or right derivation for the
parse tree.
